# Description
- Aim is to build a modular robotic platform that will enable you to develop robotic systems on top of self-surviving (e.g. charge itself in unknown environments) and self localizing (using LIDAR systems) system.

# How It Works?
RP-LIDAR 360 and Camera mounted Raspberry Pi will be the heart of this system. Raspberry Pi will utilize the following modules in order to achieve locatilaztion and self-charge from plugs;
- wheelModule
  - 4 Independent Wheels & Encoders
  - Arduino
  - Esp8266
- roboticArmModule
  - Robotic Arm
  - Arduino
  - Esp8266
- batteryModule
 - accumulator (akü)
 - Esp8266
- brainModule
  - Raspberry Pi (MQTT server, WiFi AccessPoint)
