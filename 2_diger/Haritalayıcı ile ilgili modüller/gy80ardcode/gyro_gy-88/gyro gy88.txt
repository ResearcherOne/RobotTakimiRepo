Ayrýca:
The output scale for any setting is [-32768, +32767] for each of the six axes. The default setting in the I2Cdevlib class is +/- 2g for the accel and +/- 250 deg/sec for the gyro. If the device is perfectly level and not moving, then:
X/Y accel axes should read 0
Z accel axis should read 1g, which is +16384 at a sensitivity of 2g
X/Y/Z gyro axes should read 0
In reality, the accel axes won't read exactly 0 since it is difficult to be perfectly level and there is some noise/error, and the gyros will also not read exactly 0 for the same reason (noise/error).
